found the correct double by unknown all down/up/unchanged and shooting and gathering ammo
search for double even though the actual type may be 4 byte
this narrowed down results to 30
then process of elimination by toggling groups of addresses and seeing if ammo freeze is true by unfreezing and watching number change
correct address should be first address found in list
if not: you can find the correct address by adding your narrowed results to the list and converting all to 4 byte and looking for 6 digit number starting with 524

another method is to search directly for 4 byte addresses for the shotgun for example 524000 and 525000 and the assault rifle 2490000 and 2491000
this is because we know what numbers they start with now that we have done the first search

shotgun
double
5.94161411836695E-313 - 36 rounds remaining
1.90982211553293E-313 - 17 rounds remaining
1.48542295709284E-313 - 9 rounds remaining
2.59035159655045E-318 - 5 rounds remaining
2.59033677458107E-318 - 2 rounds remaining

the number may be a 4 byte instead of a double
36 rounds with 5 in the chamber - 6.57821285550831E-313 - 524293
9 rounds with 2 in the chamber - 1.48542295709284E-313 - 524290
this means it is almost certainly a 4 byte - yet the scanner showed it as a double

assault rifle
same double search and convert to 4 byte as shotgun
109 rounds with 33 in the chamber - 2490401

health
found by touching restricted weapon for damage and searching for unknown all up and down
4 bytes
4194368 - 4 full blocks
4194354 - fourth health block almost depleted
4194352 - 3 full blocks

the current pointer seems valid for first checkpoint in tunnel under starting area
adding numbers to the scanned number (524*** for shotgun/249*** for assault rifle) increases amount of ammo by the number added
eventually the pointer/address will disappear so add as much ammo and do a checkpoint save while you can
if the pointer/address disappears you will have to rescan

pointers do not work in terms of ongoing game play because a new address is used every time ammo is picked up
pointers do work in terms of restoring game play to a checkpoint because they stay the same until ammo is picked up
so the method of increasing ammo to a large amount while you do have an address is the way to go
this is in the intro only - pointers don't seem to work at all in the actual game - just increase your value to a large number and get to checkpoint

this is for the 1.0.0.1 GOG version of the game
